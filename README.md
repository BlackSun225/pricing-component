## My process

I use html5 css3 and Javascript for the project. First i made the html, next the css and the Javascript.
This project wasn't difficult. It's a good project for a beginner who want to practice Js smoothly on a real front-end project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Responsive design
- Javascript 

### What I learned

I learned tabindex and praticed a little more localStorage. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div id="toggle" tabindex="0"><div id="circle"></div></div>
```
